Live demo available at http://shrinelords.herokuapp.com.
Backend repo here: https://github.com/yapjinai/shrinelords-backend
## The spiritual and digital merge in this technopagan haven: build and meditate in virtual shrines set in simulated nature.
+ Set up a Ruby on Rails API connecting five models, allowing React front end to persist past states of shrines to users
+ Created Javascript DOM events to manipulate Z-index and size of shrine offerings, mimicking a 3-D space
+ Connected React components as web pages via React Router to for an intuitive user experience
